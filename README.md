Spam Email Detection System
This is a machine learning-based web application built to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam. The project uses Flask, scikit-learn, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict whether an email is spam based on its content.

Features
Users can input an email through the web interface.
The system predicts whether the email is Spam or Not Spam using a trained model.
The app uses TF-IDF Vectorization for text feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification.
Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language for the backend.
Flask: For building the web application.
scikit-learn: For machine learning and model training.
Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing.
HTML/CSS: For front-end design.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Using TF-IDF Vectorization to process email text data.
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned by removing duplicates and handling missing values. Emails are converted to lowercase for consistency.
Feature Extraction: The text of the email is transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to capture important words.
Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained using the processed data to classify emails into Spam or Not Spam.
Prediction: The model takes the email input, processes it, and predicts whether it's spam or not.
Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-detection.git
cd spam-email-detection
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

For Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the web app:
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the spam email detection system.

Usage
Once the app is running, you can input an email into the provided form on the home page.
The system will display whether the email is Spam or Not Spam based on the model's prediction.
Example Emails
Here are a few example emails you can test:

Spam: "Congratulations! You've won a free iPhone. Click here to claim your prize now!"
Not Spam: "Meeting scheduled at 3 PM. Please find the agenda attached."
